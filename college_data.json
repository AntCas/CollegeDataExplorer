The Pacific Ocean is a quick 5-mile trip away, attracting surfers, sailors and sunbathers alike. Seated in Orange County, the bustling campus is home to more than 500 student organizations,&nbsp;including nearly 50 fraternities and sororities. The UC&mdash;Irvine Anteaters compete at the Division I level in the Big West Conference, cheered on by non-traditional mascot Peter the Anteater and a group of student fans called Eater Nation. While UC Irvine is known as a commuter school, university officials have tried to combat that status by offering more on-campus residence options. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, but more than three-fourths of first-year students choose to do so. Getting around UC Irvine is easy with the school&#39;s ZotWheels, a fleet of blue and gold bicycles that students can pick up and ride to four campus locations. Commuters looking to be more energy efficient can carpool to campus with other students through the university&#39;s Zimride Rideshare Community.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall",

Students can also choose from more than 250 clubs and organizations to join. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, but many opt to live in the school&rsquo;s five residential colleges. The communities, modeled after housing at England&rsquo;s Oxford and Cambridge universities, combine living and learning with group meals, poetry readings, sports and more. For students who do not live in university housing, the Commuter Assistant Program pairs freshmen with an on-campus representative to help ease the transition into college. University of Miami Division I sports teams are known as the Hurricanes and compete in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The school&rsquo;s mascot is Sebastian the Ibis, a species of marsh bird that is known for weathering tropical storms.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities",

The athletic teams are named after the state tree and cheered on by mascot Brutus Buckeye. The football stadium, which was completed in 1922, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. All Ohio State freshmen must live in one of the more than 35 residence halls across campus, unless a student is from Central Ohio and can commute from home. The Ohio State First Year Experience offers freshmen orientation, mentors and special programming to ease the transition into college. Freshmen can also go on the school&rsquo;s community service spring break, a trip to Chicago that is only open to first-year students. Local community service opportunities are easy to find through the school&rsquo;s Pay It Forward program, which includes an online listing of volunteer events. Students can also study abroad in more than 40 countries through Ohio State.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "61", "noteCharacter":

Bush Presidential Center, which comprises a Bush administration museum, library and public policy institute, and frequently hosts speakers. The SMU Mustangs sports teams play in the Division I American Athletic Conference, supported by mascot Peruna, a black stallion Shetland pony. About 2,000 students are involved in SMU Greek life, and all students can participate in annual events such as the Festival of Lights, a candlelit assembly on the school&rsquo;s Main Quad each December, and the Mane Event, a celebration of spring complete with bands and food.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "60",

The football team plays in Carrier Dome, famed as the only domed stadium in the Northeast.</p><p>The school&rsquo;s campus sits on University Hill, above the sprawling city of Syracuse in central New York state. With about 100 inches of snowfall each year, the bitterly cold winters at Syracuse University give students plenty of opportunities for skiing, snowboarding and sledding on nearby mountains. On campus, there are more than 300 student organizations. About 30 percent of Syracuse students are involved in Greek life. All freshmen and sophomore students must live in on-campus housing, though there are some exceptions. The free Connective Corridor bus shuttles transport students between campus and downtown Syracuse, where annual celebrations include a Winterfest and a Jazz Fest.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking":

Freshmen do not have to live on campus, though more than 70 percent of all undergraduates choose to do so.

Students in Arts and Sciences majors can earn hands-on credits in internships, research and teaching with the help of the university&rsquo;s Office of Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity. The Pittsburgh Panthers sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference.

Each mini-campus has its own student center and dining options. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but those who choose to do so have options on each campus, too.

All students assume the nickname at Texas A&amp;M, an academic and athletic powerhouse in central Texas. Once an all-men&rsquo;s school called the Agricultural and Mechanical College - now shortened to A&amp;M - the university today is coed and has offers a wide variety of majors and activities. Students can choose from more than 800 clubs and organizations, including nearly 60 fraternities and sororities. About 10 percent of students go Greek. More students, about 25 percent, play in Texas A&amp;M intramural sports leagues, one of the largest programs in the country. The school&rsquo;s varsity sports compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, cheered on by mascot Reveille VIII, a collie. Miss Rev, as the collie is known, is also the highest-ranking member in the school&rsquo;s Cadet Corps, the largest ROTC program in the nation (not including programs at service academies). First-year students interested in community service can get involved right away through the Freshmen in Service and Hosting program (FISH). All students can give back during The Big Event, the largest single-day, student-run volunteer effort in the country in which more than 15,000 Aggies work to improve the nearby cities of College Station and Bryan. For many students, these communities are also home; freshmen are not required to live on campus and many choose to live in College Station or Bryan.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall",

The Greek system constitutes a large part of campus life, with about a third of the student body involved in more than 50 fraternities and sororities. In fact, the school often gets the moniker &ldquo;Mother of Fraternities&rdquo; because the Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as the &quot;Cradle of Coaches&quot; for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed for Miami. The RedHawks, who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference, were known as the Redskins until 1997. The name was changed after years of controversy and a request from the Miami Indian Tribe. (The tribe is the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the &quot;M Book.&quot; Student couples who marry are known as &quot;Miami Mergers&quot; and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine&#39;s Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school.</p>"}, {"ranking":

University of California&mdash;Santa Cruz, one of 10 schools in the state&#39;s university system, residence life can define a student&#39;s experience. Nearly 100 percent of freshmen live on campus and choose one of 10 residential colleges to join. These small groups have their own campus locations, as well as unique architecture and programming. Kresge College, for example, is home to an organic garden where students can take classes; students who are members of the College Nine community are often active in volunteer efforts and the college&#39;s Alternative Spring Break trips. Students who own RVs can also choose to reside in Camper Park, a unique community of students who live in their own home-like vehicles and share a common bathroom and lounge. Student campers may live with pre-approved roommates who are full-time UCSC students or spouses. Students living in residence halls may only have overnight guests 15 times a school year, for a maximum of three nights each visit.<br /><br />On campus, there are more than 25 miles of hiking and jogging trails, and more than 100 student clubs and organizations. Only about 3 percent of students are members of the school&#39;s small Greek system. The UC Santa Cruz sports teams are independent competitors in the NCAA&#39;s Division III. Athletes are cheered on by the Banana Slug, a nontraditional, yellow earthen creature that has been recognized among the best mascots in the country. For fun, students can tour Dead Central, a room full of Grateful Dead memorabilia donated by the band to UCSC, or explore the small beach town of Santa Cruz, located on Monterey Bay. There are rides and games on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and opportunities for swimming, sailing and kayaking on the bay. To get around, students can travel on the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District buses for free with school ID. For longer road trips, Monterey is 45 miles away, and San Francisco is a 75-mile trip.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "53",

About half (45-55 percent) of all out-of-state applicants are admitted. For all who receive admission, there are about 280 student clubs and organizations on the school&rsquo;s lush campus in downtown Newark. Nearly 20 percent of students are involved in the school&#39;s large Greek system, which has about 25 fraternities and nearly 20 sororities.

The mascot is a costumed bird named YoUDee, and a group of live Blue Hen chickens reside on the school farm. Freshmen must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent&#39;s local home. When students want to leave campus, Wilmington is about 12 miles away. Philadelphia is a 45-mile drive and Baltimore is 55 miles away.

A public engineering and applied sciences school in Golden, Colorado, Mines has 14 academic departments, including Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics. The school also offers courses in the Liberal Arts &amp; International Studies and Economics &amp; Business departments. When students aren&rsquo;t studying, the school&rsquo;s location is ideal for outdoor recreation. Golden is 13 miles from the state capital of Denver and lies in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where students can bike, hike and climb. The campus also has a climbing wall for students to test their skills before attempting the Rockies. Cold-weather sports fans can partake in the annual Winter Carnival, a student-run affair packed with skiing and snowboarding at a local resort. The Mines sports teams, known as the Orediggers, compete in the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which is mostly made up of other teams from Colorado. The school mascot is Blaster the burro, and a giant &quot;M&quot; emblazoned onto nearby Mount Zion signifies the school spirit. There are more than 140 student clubs and organizations, including seven fraternities and three sororities. First-year students are required to live on campus. Even the student newspaper, The Oredigger, is decidedly science based; sections include weekly roundups of new discoveries and a Geek of the Week feature.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall",

All students can get involved in service-learning and volunteer projects throughout East Lansing like Fill the Bus, an annual campaign to stuff a Spartan-green school bus full of food and school supplies for underprivileged children. The university is home to one of the largest single-campus residence hall systems in the country, and freshmen must live on campus unless they reside with a family member no more than 50 miles from school.

Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but more than 90 percent choose to do so. Campus life may pose a challenge to tobacco users, as Iowa is a smoke-free campus. Students have more than 500 clubs and organizations from which to choose, and close to 10 percent of students go Greek as members of the school&#39;s nearly 50 fraternities and sororities. Sports are another big focus of campus life; even in the competitive NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, the Iowa Hawkeyes are notorious players. Four blocks from campus is Iowa City, a Midwestern metropolis that has been recognized among the nation&rsquo;s best for its scenery, greenery and sustainable energy efforts.</p>"}, {"ranking":

Through the Adventure Resource Center and the Outdoor Pursuits program, students can participate in organized kayaking, climbing and camping trips or can plan an excursion of their own. Winter sports fans can go skiing and snowboarding at Greek Peak, a 30-mile trip from campus. On campus, annual student events include University Fest and Spring Fling, two outdoor celebrations with live music, carnival rides and food.

One perk of living in the school&#39;s residence facilities: free laundry. The Binghamton Bearcats compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference, and student fans form the BU Zoo cheering section during basketball games. The school mascot is a bearcat named Baxter.

There are more than 750 student organizations on campus, and more than 6,500 students go Greek in the school&rsquo;s large community of fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus for at least two semesters, though there are some exceptions. The Midwestern college town of Bloomington, or B-town, as it is known to many, is home to a lively cultural scene. Arts and entertainment performances, such as the annual Lotus World Music &amp; Arts Festival, take place year-round. Students can explore the surrounding area through the Indiana University Outdoor Adventures program, which coordinates hiking, whitewater rafting and rock climbing trips. Active students can compete in the annual Little 500, the largest collegiate bike race in the nation and a fundraiser for university scholarships, or spend 36 hours on their feet in the IU Dance Marathon, a fundraiser for <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/in/riley-hospital-for-children-at-iu-health-PA6420020\">Riley Hospital for Children</a> in Indianapolis.</p>"},

The CCT, as the latter is known, is a log of all membership in clubs, any leadership positions and any marketable skills a student has gained while in college. To beef up a CCT, students can get involved in more than 200 student clubs and organizations. The school&rsquo;s Greek system has more than 10 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent&#39;s home within 20 miles of campus. Students who are at least 21 years old or married may live off campus, too. The Golden Hurricane sports teams are members of the Division I American Athletic Conference, and the school&rsquo;s mascot is a superhero named Captain Cane. Students can join in Hurricane Thursdays, campus celebrations that alternate between carnivals, concerts and more. The TU campus is two miles away from downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city of about half a million people that is home to performing arts centers, museums, shops and nightclubs. The state capital of Oklahoma City is about 100 miles away.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "50", "noteCharacter": null,

In the evenings, students can travel anywhere within the city limits for free in CU NightRide shuttles, which run until 1:15 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 12:15 a.m. all other nights. On campus, there are more than 300 student clubs and organizations and close to 40 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus. The Colorado Buffaloes compete in the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference. The student athletes, called Buffs for short, are supported by two buffalo mascots: a costumed student called Chip and a live animal named Ralphie V. The university stresses its commitment to volunteer efforts like Better Boulder Better World, a day of community service in the surrounding neighborhoods. For trips off campus, there are 11 ski slopes within 3 hours of campus, and Rocky Mountain National Park is 45 miles away. A bit closer is Denver, the state capital, where students can catch professional sports matches or concerts in the unique outdoor concert hall, Red Rocks Amphitheatre.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking":

Students can also check out more than 300 student organizations on campus, including more than 30 fraternities and sororities. On the athletic fields, the Stony Brook Seawolves compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference.

The UO Ducks sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference and draw a considerable amount of fans, especially in track and field and football. The school has a small but thriving Greek life with around 30 fraternities and sororities on campus. On-campus housing is not guaranteed, with spots filled on a first-come, first-served basis. Only about 20 percent of students live on campus, and the majority of these are underclassmen.<br /><br />There is a dual enrollment option for students who want to take courses at both UO and a local community college. While at UO, students can give their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s a boost through the Professional Distinctions Program, which incorporates extra academic concentrations, internships and career workshops. For graduate students, the University of Oregon has a highly ranked <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/university-of-oregon-06170\">College of Education</a>, as well as a <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-oregon-03135\">law school</a>, <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-oregon-lundquist-01186\">business school</a> and other graduate degree programs.

Students also have a vast array of degree options, with more than 280 majors, nearly 70 of which can be completed online. The university&#39;s hometown of Columbia is in central Missouri and is host to annual events like the Roots &#39;n Blues &#39;n BBQ music festival and Art in the Park, a large creative works showcase. To travel around campus and the town on the weekends, students have free access to STRIPES, a transportation service that delivers riders to their homes from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Sunday.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "45", "noteCharacter": null, "maxPossibleScore": null, "noteText": null, "displayRank":

sophomores must live on campus, unless they&#39;re commuting from a parent&#39;s home within 50 miles of school. Upperclassmen may live in residence halls, Greek houses or university apartments if they&#39;d like, but they aren&#39;t required to. Greek life draws about 20 percent of the student body, and, in total, there are about 150 student organizations to consider joining. The Pacific Tigers sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference. The school does not have a football team.<br /><br />Since Stockton is situated in the California Delta waterway, students are close to water sports options, including jet skiing, windsurfing and sailing. For road trips within California, Sacramento is 45 minutes away and San Francisco, Napa and San Jose are all within a 90-minute drive. In addition to its degree options for undergraduate students, the University of the Pacific has the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-the-pacific-mcgeorge-03010\">McGeorge School of Law</a>, the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-the-pacific-eberhardt-01332\">Eberhardt School of Business</a>, a <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/university-of-the-pacific-06354\">graduate school of education</a> and more.

Seton Hall students can make the most of their degrees by working with the career center, which connects them to internship and job opportunities.<br /><br />According to the school, the vast majority of SHU graduates find work in the New York or New Jersey area. But before they get that far, SHU students can explore more than 100 campus organizations, Greek life or recreational sports. More serious athletes can try out for one of the more than 15 Seton Hall Pirates varsity sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference. Notable alumni of SHU include Max Weinberg, the longtime drummer in Bruce Springsteen&#39;s E Street Band and the band leader on the television show &quot;Late Night with Conan

The school&#39;s Cardinals athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division III Landmark Conference in every sport except football. The football team plays in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference.

students. Student athletic supporters form the ZonaZoo, the student section that supports the Arizona Wildcats sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference. For athletes who don&rsquo;t compete on the school&#39;s teams, there are three levels of intramural sports: the Desert league, which emphasizes fun; the Sunset league, geared to moderate athletes; and the Cactus league, meant for very skilled and competitive athletes. For other ways to get involved, University of Arizona students can check out more than 30 fraternities and sororities, among many other student organizations.<br /><br />Freshmen are not required to live on campus, though first-year students make up about 80 percent of the on-campus residential population. Each year, the university community gathers for events like the Spring Fling, billed as the largest student-run carnival in the country, and Homecoming. As a research institution, the University of Arizona also offers a variety of opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to get involved in research projects. The university has a wide range of graduate student programs, including the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-arizona-eller-01009\">Eller College of Management</a>, the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-arizona-rogers-03004\">James E.

CSU is considered one of the leading research universities, and faculty and students work together to explore fields such as atmospheric science, infectious diseases, clean energy technologies and environmental science.<br /><br />Outside the classroom and research lab, students can get involved with the more than 350 campus organizations, including about 35 fraternities and sororities. Student athletes can find sports at the recreational, club and varsity level, with the CSU mascot and colors reflecting the school&#39;s past. CSU began as an agricultural school, so the sports teams were called the Aggies and their colors were green and gold to represent farming. The school held onto the colors, but the more than 15 varsity sports teams are now called the Rams. They compete in the NCAA Division I Mountain West Conference.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "42", "noteCharacter": null, "maxPossibleScore": null, "noteText": null, "displayRank": "#129", "isTied": true, "rankStatus": "ranked", "type": "national-universities", "sortRank": 129}, "xwalkId": "193654", "overall": {"displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "42", "maxPossibleScore": null, "noteText": null, "displayRank": "#129", "isTied": true, "rankStatus": "ranked", "noteCharacter": null, "sortRank": 129}, "institution": {"rankingNoteText": null, "rankingDisplayRank": "#129", "ranking": "overall", "primaryPhoto": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_16501.jpg", "primaryPhotoThumb": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_16501_170x170mm.jpg", "city": "New York", "sortName": "newschool", "zip": "10011", "rankingNoteCharacter": null, "rankingDisplayScore": "42", "state": "NY", "rankingSortRank": 129, "urlName": "new-school", "rankingDisplayName": "National Universities", "nonResponderText": null, "nonResponder": false, "xwalkId": "193654", "rankingIsTied": true, "isPublic": true, "displayName": "New School", "schoolType": "national-universities", "region": null, "aliasNames": null, "primaryKey": "20662", "institutionalControl": "private", "rankingMaxPossibleScore": null, "rankingRankStatus": "ranked", "rankingType": "national-universities"}, "searchData": {"major": {"dataQaId": "g_all_majors", "fieldName": "majorsOfferedBachelors", "rawValue": ["50.0401", "50.0404", "50.0407", "50.0408", "50.0409", "50.0499", "50.0605", "50.0702", "50.1002"], "displayValue": {"Visual and Performing Arts": ["Design and Applied Arts, Other", "Design and Visual Communications, General", "Fashion/Apparel Design", "Fine and Studio Arts Management", "Fine/Studio Arts, General", "Graphic Design", "Industrial and Product Design", "Interior Design", "Photography"]}}, "acceptance-rate": {"rawValue": 67, "dataQaId": "R_C_ACCEPT_RATE", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "rCAcceptRate", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "67%", "noteCharacter": null}, "enrollment": {"rawValue": 6792, "dataQaId": "TOTAL_UNDERGRADS", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "totalUndergrads", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "6,792", "noteCharacter": null}, "percent-receiving-aid": {"rawValue": 51, "dataQaId": "PCT_RECV_AID_FT_FY", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "pctRecvAidFtFy", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "51%", "noteCharacter": null}, "tuition": {"subText": null, "rawValue": 45535, "dataQaId": "v_search_tuition", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "searchTuition", "fieldType": "searchTuition", "displayValue": ["$45,535"], "noteCharacter": null}, "school-name": {"displayValue": null, "fieldName": "display_name", "rawValue": null}, "cost-after-aid": {"rawValue": 47068, "dataQaId": "C_ALL_NET_COST", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "cAllNetCost", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "$47,068", "noteCharacter": null}}, "primaryKey": ["national-universities", "overall", "20662"], "blurb": "Founded in 1919, New School is a private institution.

communities, or LCs. These clusters of students take courses together and might live together, too. Students can also check out extracurricular activities, including nearly 500 clubs and organizations. With more than 30 fraternities and sororities, Greek life options abound, and about 10 percent of the student body opts to participate. The Ohio Bobcats compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference and have a traditionally successful men&#39;s basketball team.<br /><br />Ohio University students must live on campus until they have completed four semesters. Students who commute from a parent&rsquo;s home within 50 miles of campus are exempt from the housing requirement, as are students who meet other exemption criteria. OU offers a variety of degree programs for graduate students, too, through academic departments including the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/ohio-university-06160\">College of Education</a>, the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/ohio-university-russ-02140\">Russ College of Engineering and Technology</a> and the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/ohio-university-01175\">College of Business</a>.

Now, URI offers more than 80 undergraduate majors and many master&#39;s programs as well, including those in the School of Education, the<a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-rhode-island-01197\"> College of Business Administration</a> and <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/university-of-rhode-island-02160\">College of Engineering</a>.<br /><br />Outside the classroom, students can get involved in more than 100 campus organizations or pledge one of the roughly 20 fraternities and sororities. URI students can also leave campus and make a short trip to the beach or to the state capital of Providence. Student athletes can play at the recreational, club or varsity level. Most of the nearly 20 URI Rams sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference, cheered on by their mascot Rhody. Notable URI alumni include oceanographer Robert Ballard, who discovered the sunken Titanic, and journalist Christiane Amanpour.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National

The university also offers many <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/missouri-university-of-science--technology-02095\">engineering graduate degree programs</a>. However, undergraduate students can also opt to study humanities or several liberal arts disciplines, such as philosophy and history.<br /><br />Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they commute from their family&#39;s home, among other exceptions. Students can apply to live in traditional residence halls, suites, apartments or even the university&rsquo;s Solar Village, a community of solar homes that students build and later live in. About 20 percent of Missouri S&amp;T students join fraternities and sororities. The student community comes together for annual events, including the Snowball Semiformal, Fall Fest and a weeklong celebration of St. Patrick&#39;s Day. The Missouri S&amp;T Miners compete in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference. Notable alumni of the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology include Joe Ballard, former commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and several NASA astronauts.</p>"}, {"ranking":

Outside the classroom, University of Maine students participate in many annual events. When freshmen move into the dorms before fall semester, faculty and staff volunteers greet the new students, help them move in and direct traffic as part of the Maine Hello program. Each spring, classes are canceled for Maine Day, when the university community hosts a parade, and then everyone helps clean the campus.</p><p>The university, often called UMaine, also has more than 200 student organizations and about 25 fraternities and sororities for students to join. Student athletes at UMaine can get involved at the intramural, club and varsity levels. The UMaine Black Bears intercollegiate sports teams compete in various conferences of the NCAA Division I and are best known for hockey. Notable UMaine alumni include bestselling horror author Stephen King, who wrote &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National

Students at Kent State can choose from more than 300 academic programs, including graduate degrees from the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/kent-state-university-01172\">College of Business Administration</a>, the <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/kent-state-university-06157\">College of Education, Health and Human Services</a> and the highly ranked <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/kent-state-university-kent-campus-203517\">School of Speech Pathology and Audiology</a>. Undergraduates at Kent State have a unique opportunity to earn a degree in peace and conflict studies, which is offered through the Center for Applied Conflict Management. This center was created shortly after the headline-making 1970 incident in which Ohio National Guardsmen killed four Kent State students during a Vietnam War protest.<br /><br />Outside the classroom, Kent State students can get involved in more than 200 campus organizations, including Greek life, leadership programs and community service clubs. There are also many events nearby at the Blossom Music Center, the Porthouse Theatre and the Wick Poetry Center, as well as in the neighboring cities of Cleveland and Akron. Student athletes can get involved by playing intramural sports or by trying out for the many Kent State Golden Flashes varsity teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference. The members of new wave band Devo attended Kent, as did actor Michael Keaton, comedian Drew Carey and writer David Sedaris, although they did not graduate. Kent State alumni include former talk show host Arsenio Hall and many NFL players, including two-time Super Bowl winner James Harrison.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName":

Undergraduates at Bowling Green can choose from more than 200 degrees, and master&#39;s students can choose from about 50 graduate programs, including in the fields of <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/bowling-green-state-university-01168\">business</a>, <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/bowling-green-state-university-06154\">education</a> and <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/bowling-green-state-university-main-campus-201441\">health</a>. The BGSU campus is home to several unique buildings, such as the music building, which looks like a baby grand piano from above, and the recreation center, which resembles the school&#39;s falcon mascot from above.</p><p>Students can join nearly 300 clubs, about 40 Greek organizations and maybe even the SICSIC spirit crew. This group, which has been around since the 1940s, consists of six anonymous members who dress in Halloween masks and work uniforms and secretly post spirit messages and signs on campus. Student athletes can play at the recreational level or try out for one of the many BGSU Falcons varsity sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference. Notable alumni include Academy Award-winning actress Eva Marie Saint, who was named Bowling Green&#39;s Pi Kappa Alpha Dream Girl before she went on to star in the movies &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;North by Northwest.&quot;</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": "29", "noteCharacter": null,

University of Montana students can also earn course credit by interning with the school&#39;s Program in Ecological Agriculture and Society (PEAS).&nbsp; During the internship, students work on the university&#39;s 10-acre farm, which produces crops for emergency food shelters. The university, which is often abbreviated to UM, also offers many academic programs and student organizations that focus on American Indian culture.<br /><br />Outside the classroom, students can join more than 150 clubs, Greek life and intramural and club sports teams. More serious athletes can try out for the Montana Griz (as in Grizzlies) varsity teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Big Sky Conference. Notable UM alumni include Carroll O&#39;Connor, who starred as Archie Bunker in the television show &quot;All in the Family&quot;; Colin Meloy, the lead singer of The Decemberists; and actor J.K.

system. At SFSU, it&rsquo;s important to apply for university housing early, as there aren&rsquo;t enough spaces for every student. Freshmen can apply to live in school residence halls&mdash;including a science and technology themed building, and university apartment complexes group students by age, not year in school. SFSU is commuter-friendly, with public transportation stops near campus. There are about 300 student organizations to consider, including fraternities and sororities. Most of the SF State sports teams compete in the NCAA Division II California Collegiate Athletic Association; the school&rsquo;s wrestling team is a member of the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference.<br /><br />Among San Francisco State&rsquo;s diverse undergraduate academic offerings is the College of Ethnic studies, a unique division with majors including Africana studies, Asian American studies, and La Raza studies. For graduate students, SFSU has schools of <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/san-francisco-state-university-01025\">business</a>, <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-education-schools/san-francisco-state-university-06345\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/san-francisco-state-university-122597\">health</a>, and more. Notable alumni of SFSU include Jeffrey Tambor, a veteran of TV sitcoms including <em>Arrested Development</em>; Danny Glover, star of the <em>Lethal Weapon</em> movies; and Charles Hall, inventor of the waterbed.</p>"}, {"ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": null, "noteCharacter": null, "maxPossibleScore": null, "noteText": null, "displayRank": "RNP", "isTied": false, "rankStatus": "rnp", "type": "national-universities", "sortRank": -1}, "xwalkId": "157757", "overall": {"displayName": "National Universities", "displayScore": null, "maxPossibleScore": null, "noteText": null, "displayRank": "RNP", "isTied": false, "rankStatus": "rnp", "noteCharacter": null, "sortRank": -1}, "institution": {"rankingNoteText": null, "rankingDisplayRank": "RNP", "ranking": "overall", "primaryPhoto": null, "primaryPhotoThumb": null, "city": "Louisville", "sortName": "spaldinguniversity", "zip": "40203", "rankingNoteCharacter": null, "rankingDisplayScore": null, "state": "KY", "rankingSortRank": -1, "urlName": "spalding-university", "rankingDisplayName": "National Universities", "nonResponderText": "School refused to fill out U.S. News statistical survey.
